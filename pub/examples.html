		<p>The first example below generates a non-editable balance sheet. The subtotals and totals have been calculated. Additionally, a cash subcomponent has been added. The rows of the subcomponent can be hidden or shown by clicking the appropriate buttons. Lastly, the table rows can be dragged and dropped to rearrange the table row order.</p>

		<p>The second example below generates an editable income sheet. The subtotals and totals have been calculated, with the net income label as the total. Links have been added to the total income and total expenses. If income and expenses are edited, the subtotals and totals will edit. If they do not match across tables, a red message will appear notifying the user that the balances do not match. Functions previously shown above are excluded from the code snippet below.</p>

		<p>The third example below generates an editable, budegted income sheet. The subtotals and totals have been calculated, with the net income label as the total. Links have been added to the total income and total expenses. If income and expenses are edited, the subtotals and totals will edit. If they do not match across tables, a red message will appear notifying the user that the balances do not match. Additionally, actual and budgeted values can be modified. As these values change, the differences and % differences are recalculated. If the differences are above the specified threshold, they will appear in green and if they are below the threshold, they appear in red. Functions previously shown above are excluded from the code snippet below.</p>
